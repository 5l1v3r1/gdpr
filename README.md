Note: These tools are under active development.  We're remove this message when they are ready for testing by others.

The [General Data Protection Regulation](https://ec.europa.eu/commission/priorities/justice-and-fundamental-rights/data-protection/2018-reform-eu-data-protection-rules_en) (“GDPR”) requires compaines hosting personal data collected from users in the European Economic Union to follow rules on how to handle that data and provide users certain rights to that data.

Two important rights that GDPR provides to users are 

  * the right of access, and 
  * the right to erasure (aka “the right to be forgotten”). 

When a user joins a recorded meeting, any information they share -- which includes video, slides, desktop, chat, and emoji icons, responses to polls, and whiteboard annotations, and other content during a session will be captured in the recording.

To help you comply with the GDPR, this repository contains two tools -- `bbb-user-data` and `bbb-user-data-forget` -- that you can run on a BigBlueButton server to create a report on what personal data is held in recordings and to remove a user's personal data from a recording.


## bbb-user-data

`bbb-user-data` will take `userID` and path to a recording and generate a report of content in that recording generated by the given user.

### Usage

~~~
./bbb-user-data -u <user_id> -r <recording_path>
~~~

### Example:

~~~
./bbb-user-data -u w_g3btthk9p3cz -r /var/bigbluebutton/recording/raw/5b8a1a13f463a1e51d9e32cc0d3fc8af31e713f1-1527540655345
~~~

## bbb-user-data-forget

`bbb-user-data-forget` will take `userID` and path to a recording and remove all user events and media from the given recording (it will overwrite any speaking sections for that user with silence) and rebuild the recording.

### Usage
~~~
./bbb-user-data-forget -u <user_id> -r <recording_path>
~~~

Takes a username (aka user_id) and a RecordingPath.
Delete all the information regarding the specific user. Including all the camera recording, presentation and Deskshare

### Example
~~~
./bbb-user-data-forget -u w_g3btthk9p3cz -r /var/bigbluebutton/recording/raw/5b8a1a13f463a1e51d9e32cc0d3fc8af31e713f1-1527540655345
