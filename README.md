The [General Data Protection Regulation](https://ec.europa.eu/commission/priorities/justice-and-fundamental-rights/data-protection/2018-reform-eu-data-protection-rules_en) (“GDPR”) requires compaines hosting personal data collected from users in the European Economic Union to follow rules on how to handle that data and provide users certain rights to that data.

Two important rights that GDPR provides to users are 

  * the right of access, and 
  * the right to erasure (aka “the right to be forgotten”). 

When a user joins a recorded meeting, any information they share -- which includes video, slides, desktop, chat, and emoji icons, responses to polls, and whiteboard annotations, and other content during a session will be captured in the recording.

To help you comply with the GDPR, this repository contains a tool -- `bbb-user` -- that you can run on a BigBlueButton server to create a report on what personal data is held in recordings and to remove a user's personal data from a recording.


## bbb-user

`bbb-user` will take `userID`, path to a recording and a flag and generate a report of content in that recording generated by the given user.

### Usage

~~~
./bbb-user -u <user_id> -r <recordings_dir_path> -g|-D
~~~

### Example of retrieving users info:

~~~
./bbb-user -u w_g3btthk9p3cz -r /var/bigbluebutton/recording/raw/ -g
~~~

### Example of deleting users info:

~~~
./bbb-user-forget -u <user_id> -r <recordings_dir_path> -D 
~~~
